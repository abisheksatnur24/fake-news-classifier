# CS4824-Final-Project
All ipynbs should be able to work just by running them in the proper environment with correct pip installs before hand.
The follow pip libraries were utilized: pandas, numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, scipy, BeautifulSoup, nltk.  
  
-CNN was done by Caleb  
-Naive Bayes by Abishek  
-Random Forest by Andrew  
  
Decision Tree Classification was working up until right before submission. I had messed around with something to account for additional datatypes that were not csr_matrices and ended up breaking the code somehow. I didn't have version control and ran out of time debugging due to the sheer amount of time it took to run the model. I was preparing it for final scores; however, I noticed it was broken too late. I am so sorry about this and will do my best to attempt to resolve these errors over the next couple days ahead of our presentation if it will not be too late to still resubmit. -Andrew Istfan
